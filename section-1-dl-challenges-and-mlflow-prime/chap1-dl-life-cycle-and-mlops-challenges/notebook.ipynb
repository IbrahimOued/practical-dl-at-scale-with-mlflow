    "While research in areas of deep learning has made giant leaps, bringing these DL models from offline experimentation to production and continuously improving the models to deliver sustainable values is still a challenge. For example, a recent article by VentureBeat (https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/19/why-do-87-of-data-science-projects-never-make-it-into-production/) found that $87\\%$ of data science projects never make it to production. While there might be business reasons for such a low production rate, a major contributing factor is the difficulty caused by the lack of experiment management and a mature model production and feedback platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter will help us to understand the challenges and bridge these gaps by learning the concepts, steps, and components that are commonly used in the full life cycle of DL model development. Additionally, we will learn about the challenges of an emerging field known as Machine Learning Operations (MLOps), which aims to standardize and automate ML life cycle development, deployment, and operation. Having a solid understanding of these challenges will motivate us to learn the skills presented in the rest of this book using MLflow, an open source, ML full life cycle platform. The business values of adopting MLOps' best practices are numerous; they include faster time-to-market of model-derived product features, lower operating costs, agile A/B testing, and strategic decision making to ultimately improve customer experience"

    "1. **Self-supervised learning**: This refers to the pretraining of a model in a data-rich domain that does not require labeled data. This step produces a pretrained model, which is also called a foundation model, for example, BERT, GPT-3 for NLP, and VGG-NETS for computer vision.\n",

    "Unlike classical ML model development, where, usually, a feature engineering step is required to extract and transform raw data into features to train an ML model such as decision tree or logistic regression, DL can learn the features automatically, which is especially attractive for modeling unstructured data such as texts, images, videos, audio, and speeches. DL is also called representational learning due to this characteristic. In addition to this, DL is usually data- and compute-intensive, requiring Graphics Process Units (GPUs), Tensor Process Units (TPU), or other types of computing hardware accelerators for at-scale training and inference. Explainability for DL models is also harder to implement, compared with traditional ML models, although recent progress has now made that possible."

    "MLOps has some connections to DevOps, where a set of technology stacks and standard operational procedures are used for software development and deployment combined with IT operations. Unlike traditional software development, ML and especially DL represent a new era of software development paradigms called Software 2.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here are the three foundation layers:\n",
    "  * Infrastructure management and automation\n",
    "  * Application life cycle management and Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\n",
    "  * Service system observability\n",
    "* Here are the four pillars:\n",
    "  * Data observability and management\n",
    "  * Model observability and life cycle management\n",
    "  * Explainability and Artificial Intelligence (AI) observability\n",
    "  * Code reproducibility and observability\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will explain MLflow's roles in these MLOps layers and pillars so that we have a clear picture regarding what MLflow can do to build up the MLOps layers in their entirety:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Infrastructure management and automation: This includes, but is not limited to, Kubernetes (also known as k8s) for automated container orchestration and Terraform (commonly used for managing hundreds of cloud services and access control). These tools are adapted to manage ML and DL applications that have deployed models as service endpoints. These infrastructure layers are not the focus of this book; instead, we will focus on how to deploy a trained DL model using MLflow's provided capabilities.\n",
    "* Application life cycle management and CI/CD: This includes, but is not limited to, Docker containers for virtualization, container life cycle management tools such as Kubernetes, and CircleCI or Concourse for CI and CD. Usually, CI means that whenever there are code or model changes in a GitHub repository, a series of automatic tests will be triggered to make sure no breaking changes are introduced. Once these tests have been passed, new changes will be automatically released as part of a new package. This will then trigger a new deployment process (CD) to deploy the new package to the production environment (often, this will include human approval as a safety gate). Note that these tools are not unique to ML applications but have been adapted to ML and DL applications, especially when we require GPU and distributed clusters for the training and testing of DL models. In this book, we will not focus on these tools but will mention the integration points or examples when needed.\n",
    "* Service system observability: This is mostly for monitoring the hardware/clusters/CPU/memory/storage, operating system, service availability, latency, and throughput. This includes tools such as Grafana, Datadog, and more. Again, these are not unique to ML and DL applications and are not the focus of this book.\n",
    "* Data observability and management: This is traditionally under-represented in the DevOps world but becomes very important in MLOps as data is critical within the full life cycle of ML/DL models. This includes data quality monitoring, outlier detection, data drift and concept drift detection, bias detection, secured and compliant data sharing, data provenance tracking and versioning, and more. The tool stacks in this area that are suitable for ML and DL applications are still emerging. A few examples include DataFold (https://www.datafold.com/) and Databand (https://databand.ai/open-source/). A recent development in data management is a unified lakehouse architecture and implementation called Delta Lake (http://delta.io) that can be used for ML data management. MLflow has native integration points with Delta Lake, and we will cover that integration in this book.\n",
    "* Model observability and life cycle management: This is unique to ML/DL models, and it only became widely available recently due to the rise of MLflow. This includes tools for model training, testing, versioning, registration, deployment, serialization, model drift monitoring, and more. We will learn about the exciting capabilities that MLflow provides in this area. Note that once we combine CI/CD tools with MLflow training/monitoring, user feedback loops, and human annotations, we can achieve Continuous Training, Continuous Testing, and Continuous Labeling. MLflow provides the foundational capabilities so that further automation in MLOps becomes possible, although such complete automation will not be the focus of this book. Interested readers can find relevant references at the end of this chapter to explore this area further.\n",
    "* Explainability and AI observability: This is unique to ML/DL models and is especially important for DL models, as traditionally, DL models are treated as black boxes. Understanding why the model provides certain predictions is critical for societally important applications. For example, in medical, financial, juridical, and many human-in-the-loop decision support applications, such as civilian and military emergency response, the demand for explainability is increasingly higher. MLflow provides native integration with a popular explainability framework called SHAP, which we will cover in this book.\n",
    "* Code reproducibility and observability: This is not entirely unique to ML/DL applications. However, DL models face some special challenges as the number of DL code frameworks are diverse and the need to reproduce a model is not entirely up to the code alone (we also need data and execution environments such as GPU clusters). In addition to this, notebooks are commonly used in model development and production. How to manage the notebooks along with the model run is important. Usually, GitHub is used to manage the code repository; however, we need to structure the ML project code in a way that's reproducible either locally (such as on a local laptop) or remotely (for example, in a Databricks' GPU cluster). MLflow provides this capability to allow DL projects that have been written once to run anywhere, whether this is in an offline experimentation environment or an online production environment. We will cover MLflow's MLproject capability in this book."
