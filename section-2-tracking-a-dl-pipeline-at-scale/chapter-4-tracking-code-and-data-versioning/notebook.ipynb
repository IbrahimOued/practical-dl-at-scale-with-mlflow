    "DL models are not just models â€“ **they are intimately tied to the code that trains and tests the model and the data that's used for training and testing**. **If we don't track the code and data that's used for the model, it is impossible to reproduce the model or improve it**. Furthermore, there have been recent industry-wide awakenings and paradigm shifts toward a [data-centric AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gilpress/2021/06/16/andrew-ng-launches-a-campaign-for-data-centric-ai/?sh=5cbacdc574f5), where **the importance of data is being lifted to a first-class artifact in building ML and, especially, DL models**. Due to this, we will learn **how to track code and data versioning using MLflow**. We will learn about **the different ways we can track code and pipeline versioning and how to use Delta Lake for data versioning**. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to understand and implement tracking techniques for both code and data with MLflow."

    "Data scientists usually start by experimenting with Python notebooks offline, where interactive execution is a key benefit. The success and popularity of Jupyter notebooks are undeniable. However, there are limitations when it comes to using version control for Jupyter notebooks since Jupyter notebooks are stored as JSON data with mixed output and code.

    "Having discussed **notebook code tracking (version and filename)**, let's turn to the topic of pipeline tracking. Before we discuss pipeline tracking, however, we will discuss **the definition of a pipeline in the ML/DL life cycle**. Conceptually, **a pipeline is a multi-step data processing and task workflow. However, the implementation of such a data/task workflow can be quite different**. **A pipeline can be defined as a first-class Python API in some ML packages**. The two most well-known pipeline APIs are as follows:\n",
    "* [**`sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline`**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html): This is widely used for building tightly integrated multi-step pipelines for classical machine learning or data extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines using [`pandas DataFrames`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).\n",
    "* [**`pyspark.ml.Pipeline`**](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.Pipeline.html): This is a PySpark version for building simple and tightly integrated multi-step pipelines for machine learning or data ETL pipelines using [`Spark DataFrames`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when we're building a DL model pipeline, **we need to use multiple different Python packages at different steps of the pipeline**, so a one-size-fits-all approach using a single pipeline API doesn't usually work. In addition, neither of the aforementioned pipeline APIs have native support for the current popular DL packages, such as **Huggingface** or **PyTorch**, which require additional integration work. Although some open source DL pipeline APIs exist such as [**Neuraxle**](https://github.com/Neuraxio/Neuraxle), which tries to provide a sklearn-like pipeline interface and framework, it is not widely used. Furthermore, using these API-based pipelines means that you'll be locked in when you need to add more steps to the pipeline, which could reduce your flexibility to extend or evolve a DL pipeline when new requirements arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, we will take a different approach to define and build a DL pipeline that's based on [MLflow's MLproject](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#mlproject-file) structure. This will give you the most flexibility to build a multi-step pipeline that can be tracked using MLflow. At the same time, for each step, you will be allowed to use the most appropriate DL or data processing packages without being locked in. Let's walk through this by breaking the single file-based Python notebook, `fine_tuning.py`, into a multiple-step pipeline. This pipeline can be visualized as a three-step flow diagram, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](3_step_pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the data to a local execution environment\n",
    "2. Fine-tune the model\n",
    "3. Register the model\n",
    "\n",
    "These modular steps may seem to be overkill for our current example, but the power of having a distinctive functional step is evident when more complexities are involved, or when changes are needed at each step. Each step can be modified without them affecting the other steps if we define the parameters that need to be passed between them. Each step is a standalone Python file that can be executed independently with a set of input parameters. There will be a main pipeline Python file that can run the whole pipeline or a sub-section of the pipeline's steps. In the MLproject file, which is a standard YAML file without the file extension, we can define four entry points (`main`, `download_data`, `fine_tuning_model`, and `register_model`), their required input parameters, their types and default values, and the command line to execute each entry point. In our example, these entry points will be provided in a Python command-line execution command. However, you can invoke any kind of execution, such as a batch shell script, if needed for any particular steps. For example, the following lines in the `MLproject` file describe the name of the project, the conda environment definition filename, and the main entry point:\n",
    "\n",
    "The `entry_points` section lists the first entry point, called main. In the parameters section, there is one parameter called `pipeline_steps`, which allows the user to define a comma-separated list of DL pipeline steps to execute. This parameter is of the `str` type and its default value is all, which means that all the pipeline steps will run. Lastly, the command section lists how to execute this step in the command line.\\\n",
    "The rest of the MLproject file defines the other three pipeline step entry points by following the same syntactic convention as the main entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the next step is **to implement the Python function to execute each step of the pipeline**. So, let's look at the core implementation of the main entry point's Python function, which is called `main.py.` The following lines of code (not the entire Python code in `main.py`) illustrate the core component of implementing the entire pipeline with just one step in the pipeline (`download_data`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@click.command()\n",
    "@click.option(\"--steps\", default=\"all\", type=str)\n",
    "def run_pipeline(steps):\n",
    "    with mlflow.start_run(run_name='pipeline', nested=True) as active_run:\n",
    "        download_run = mlflow.run(\".\", \"download_data\", parameters={})\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    run_pipeline()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This main function snippet contains a `run_pipeline` function, which will be run when the `main.py` file is executed in the command line. There is a parameter called `steps`, which will be passed to this function when it's provided. In this example, we are using the [click Python package](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) to parse command-line arguments. The `run_pipeline` function **starts an MLflow experiment run by calling `mlflow.start_run` and passing two parameters (`run_name` and `nested`)**. We have used `run_name` before â€“ it's the descriptive phrase for this run. However, the `nested` parameter is new, **which means that this is a parent experiment run**. **This parent experiment run contains some child experiment runs that will be hierarchically tracked in MLflow**. **Each parent run can contain one or more child runs**. In the example code, this contains one step of the pipeline run, called `download_data`, which is invoked by calling `mlflow.run`. This is the key MLflow function to invoke an MLproject's entry point programmatically. Once `download_data` has been invoked and the run has finished, the parent run will also finish, thus concluding the pipeline's run."

    "Now, let's learn how to implement each step in the pipeline generically. For each pipeline step, **we put the Python files in a pipeline folder**. In this example, we have three files: `download_data.py`, `fine_tuning_model.py`, and `register_model.py`. Thus, the relevant files for successfully building an MLflow supported pipeline project are as follows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "MLproject\n",
    "conda.yaml\n",
    "main.py\n",
    "pipeline/download_data.py\n",
    "pipeline/fine_tuning_model.py\n",
    "pipeline/register_model.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the implementation of each pipeline step, we can use the following Python function templates. A placeholder section is reserved for implementing the actual pipeline step logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import click\n",
    "import mlflow\n",
    "@click.command()\n",
    "@click.option(\"input\")\n",
    "def task(input):\n",
    "    with mlflow.start_run() as mlrun:\n",
    "        # Implement pipeline step logic here \n",
    "        mlflow.log_parameter('parameter', parameter)\n",
    "        mlflow.set_tag('pipeline_step', __file__)\n",
    "        mlflow.log_artifacts(artifacts, artifact_path=\"data\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    task()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This template allows us to standardize the way we implement the pipeline step task. The main idea here is that for each pipeline step task, it needs to start with `mlflow.start_run` to launch an MLflow experiment run. Once we've implemented specific execution logic in the function, we need to log some parameters using `mlflow.log_parameter`, or some artifacts in the artifact store using `mlflow.log_artifacts`, that can be passed to and used by the next step of the pipeline. This is called **pipeline chaining**, and it allows multiple steps of a single pipeline or even different pipelines to share data and artifacts. We also want to set a tag to indicate which step is executed using `mlflow.set_tag`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the download_data.py step, the core implementation is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import click\n",
    "import mlflow\n",
    "from flash.core.data.utils import download_data\n",
    "@click.command()\n",
    "@click.option(\"--download_url\")\n",
    "@click.option(\"--local_folder\")\n",
    "@click.option(\"--pipeline_run_name\")\n",
    "def task(download_url, local_folder, pipeline_run_name):\n",
    "    with mlflow.start_run(run_name=pipeline_run_name) as mlrun:\n",
    "        download_data(download_url, local_folder)\n",
    "        mlflow.log_param(\"download_url\", download_url)\n",
    "        mlflow.log_param(\"local_folder\", local_folder)\n",
    "        mlflow.set_tag('pipeline_step', __file__)\n",
    "        mlflow.log_artifacts(local_folder, artifact_path=\"data\")\n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    task()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this `download_data.py` implementation, the task is to download the data for model building from a remote URL to a local folder (`download_data(download_url, local_folder)`). Once we've done this, we will log a few parameters, such as `download_url` and `local_folder`. We can also log the newly downloaded data into the MLflow artifact store using `mlflow.log_artifacts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> For this example, this may not seem necessary since we only want to execute the next step in a local development environment. However, for a more realistic scenario in a distributed execution environment where each step could be run in different execution environments, this is very desirable since we only need to pass the artifact URL path to the next step of the pipeline to use; we don't need to know how and where the previous step was executed\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, when the `mlflow.log_artifacts(local_folder, artifact_path=\"data\")` statement is called, the downloaded data folder is uploaded to the MLflow artifact store. However, we will not use this artifact path for the downstream pipeline step in this chapter. We will explore how we use this kind of artifact store to pass artifacts to the next step in the pipeline later in this book. **Here, we will use the log parameters to pass the downloaded data path to the next step of the pipeline** (`mlflow.log_param(\"local_folder\", local_folder)`). So, let's look at how we can do that by extending main.py so that it includes the next step, which is the `fine_tuning_model` entry point, as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run(run_name='pipeline', nested=True) as active_run:\n",
    "    download_run = mlflow.run(\".\", \"download_data\", parameters={})\n",
    "    download_run = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient().get_run(download_run.run_id)\n",
    "    file_path_uri = download_run.data.params['local_folder']\n",
    "    fine_tuning_run = mlflow.run(\".\", \"fine_tuning_model\", parameters={\"data_path\": file_path_uri})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**We use `mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient().get_run` to get the `download_run` MLflow run object and then use `download_run.data.params` to get `file_path_uri` (in this case, it is just a local folder path)**. This is then passed to the next `mlflow.run`, which is `fine_tuning_run`, as a key-value parameter (`parameters={\"data_path\": file_path_uri`). This way, the `fine_tuning_run` pipeline step **can use this parameter to prefix its data source path**. This is **a very simplified scenario to illustrate how we can pass data from one step to the next**. Using the `mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()` API, which is provided by [MLflow](https://www.mlflow.org/docs/latest/python_api/mlflow.tracking.html), makes **accessing a run's information (parameters, metrics, and artifacts) straightforward**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also extend the `main.py` file with the third step of the pipeline by adding the `register_model` step. This time, we need the logged model URI to register a trained model, which depends on `run_id` of the `fine_tuning_model` step. So, in the `fine_tuning_model` step, we need to get the run_id property of fine_tuning_model run and then pass it through the input parameter for the `register_model` run, as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fine_tuning_run_id = fine_tuning_run.run_id\n",
    "register_model_run = mlflow.run(\".\", \"register_model\", parameters={\"mlflow_run_id\": fine_tuning_run_id})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the register_model step can use fine_tuning_run_id to locate the logged model. The core implementation of the register_model step is as follows:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "with mlflow.start_run() as mlrun:\n",
    "    logged_model = f'runs:/{mlflow_run_id}/model'\n",
    "    mlflow.register_model(logged_model, registered_model_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will register a fine-tuned model at the URI defined by the `logged_model` variable to an MLflow model registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have followed these steps, then you should have a working pipeline that can be tracked by MLflow from end to end. Then run the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python main.py\n",

Let's assume that you have a privately built project called `cool-dl-utils`, that the organization you work for is called `cool_org`, and that your project's repository has been set up in GitHub. If you want to include this project's Python package in the requirements file, you need to make sure that you add your public key to your GitHub settings. If you want to learn how to generate a public key and load it into GitHub, take a look at [GitHub's guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account). In the `requirements.txt` file, you can add the following line, which will reference a specific GitHub hash (`81218891bbf5a447103884a368a75ffe65b17a44`) and the Python `.egg` package that was built from this private repository (you can also reference a `.whl` package if you wish):\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a numerically released version in your privately built package, you can also directly reference the release number in the requirements.txt file, as follows:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git+ssh://git@github.com/cool_org/cool-dl-utils.git@2.11.4\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here the release number of `cool-dl-utils` is `2.11.4`. This allows MLflow to pull this privately built package into the virtual environment to execute `MLproject`. In this chapter, we don't need to reference any privately built Python packages, but it is worth noting that MLflow can leverage the `git+ssh` approach to do that.\n",

    "We'll learn how data is tracked in MLflow. Historically, data management and versioning are usually considered as being different from machine learning and data science. However, the advent of data-centric AI is playing an increasingly important role, particularly in DL. Therefore, it is critical to know what and how data is being used to improve the DL model. [In the first data-centric AI competition, which was organized by Andrew Ng in the summer of 2021, the requirements to become a winner were not about changing and tuning a model, but rather improving the dataset of a fixed model](https://https-deeplearning-ai.github.io/data-centric-comp/). Here is a quote from the competition's web page:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The Data-Centric AI Competition inverts the traditional format and asks you to improve a dataset, given a fixed model. We will provide you with a dataset to improve by applying data-centric techniques such as fixing incorrect labels, adding examples that represent edge cases, applying data augmentation, and so on.\""

    "This paradigm shift highlights the importance of data in deep learning, especially supervised deep learning, where labeled data is important. **An implied underlying assumption is that different data will produce different model metrics, even if the same model architecture and parameters are used**. This requires us to diligently track the data versioning process so that we know which version of the data is being used to produce the winning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several emerging frameworks for tracking data versioning in the ML/DL life cycle. One of the early pioneers in this domain is [DVC](http://dvc.org). It uses a set of GitHub-like commands to pull/push data as if they are code. It allows the data to be stored remotely in S3, or Google Drive, among many other popular stores. However, the data that's stored in the remote store becomes hashed and isn't human-readable. This becomes a locked-in problem since the only way to access the data is through the DVC tool and configuration. In addition, it is hard to track how the data and its schema have been changed. While it is possible to integrate MLflow with DVC, its usability and flexibility are not as desirable as we want. Thus, we will not deep dive into this approach in this book. If you are interested in this, we suggest that you utilize the *Versioning data and models in ML projects using DVC and AWS* reference at the end of this chapter to find more details about using DVC."

    "The recently open sourced and open format-based [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is **a practical solution for integrated data management and version control in a DL/ML project, especially since MLflow can directly support such integration**. This is also the foundational data management layer, called [Lakehouse](https://databricks.com/blog/2020/01/30/what-is-a-data-lakehouse.html), which **unifies both data warehouse and streaming data into one data foundation layer**. It supports both schema change tracking and data versioning, which is ideal or a DL/ML data use scenario. Delta tables are based on the open standard file format called [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), which is widely supported for large-scale data storage."
